# Multi-threaded-Web-Server
This project involves the development of a multi-threaded web server capable of handling simultaneous service requests on multiple ports. The primary goal is to create a functional web server that can process GET requests, serve static content, and demonstrate the ability to handle multiple connections concurrently.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/Simon-Blamo/Multi-threaded-Web-Server.git`

   `cd Multi-threaded-Web-Server`
   
2. Run the WebServer1 class to start the server.

   `java WebServer1`
3. Open your web browser and access the following URLs:

   - http://localhost:8888/index.html for regular HTTP service.

   - http://localhost:5555/ to trigger the automatic redirection to Google.
